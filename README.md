# mdl-summary_loader

## Replace 'path/to/your/model.zip', 'path/to/extraction/directory', 'model_file.h5', 'validation_data', and 'test_data' with the appropriate paths and variables for your specific setup. This script will extract the model files, load the model, print its summary, evaluate its performance, visualize its outputs, and perform additional analysis as needed, all in one go.
