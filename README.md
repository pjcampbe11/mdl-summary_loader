# mdl-summary_loader

Replace 'path/to/your/model.zip', 'path/to/extraction/directory', 'model_file.h5', 'validation_data', and 'test_data' with the appropriate paths and variables for your specific setup. This script will extract the model files, load the model, print its summary, evaluate its performance, visualize its outputs, and perform additional analysis as needed, all in one go.

The steps below explain the purpose of both the uploaded python script and the code blocks used here as examples. The only difference being the python versions each are compatable with. The code here in the README expects python3.8 or later and the uploaded script can work with legacy python versions such as 2.7

Assuming you're starting with a zipped model (e.g., .h5 for TensorFlow/Keras once extracted) and that file is local to your machine. 

Extract the Model Files:

Begin by extracting the contents of the downloaded ZIP file containing the AI model. You can use Python's built-in zipfile module to accomplish this task.
```
import zipfile
import os

# Path to the ZIP file
zip_file_path = 'path/to/your/model.zip'

# Directory to extract the contents
extraction_dir = 'path/to/extraction/directory'

# Extract the contents of the ZIP file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extraction_dir)
```
Load the Model:

Once the model files are extracted, load the model using the appropriate library. For example, if you're working with a deep learning model trained using TensorFlow, you can use TensorFlow's tf.keras.models.load_model() function.
```
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Path to the model file (e.g., .h5 for TensorFlow/Keras)
model_path = os.path.join(extraction_dir, 'model_file.h5')

# Load the model
model = load_model(model_path)
```
Inspect Model Architecture:

Print a summary of the model architecture to understand its structure, including the layers, parameters, and output shapes.
```
# Print model summary
print(model.summary())
```
Evaluate Model Performance:

Evaluate the performance of the model on a validation or test dataset to assess its accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics.
```
# Evaluate model performance
evaluation_results = model.evaluate(validation_data)
print("Evaluation results:", evaluation_results)
```
Visualize Model Outputs:

Visualize the model's predictions or outputs to gain insights into its behavior and performance.
```
# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)

# Visualize predictions or other relevant metrics
# (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve)
```
